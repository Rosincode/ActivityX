# ActivityX
A random activity picker for Android mobile devices

A social planning application that provides people (in a group) surprising activities based on their criteria like categories, budget, accessibility, age, distance etcetera. The application must be available on android devices.

The application will use the provided criteria for selecting a surprise activity. The application then shows an arrow (compass), pointing to the right location. The user is now able to navigate to the location for a new activity. When you are in vicinity of the destination, the activity details will be revealed. 
The user(s) can now enter the activity and enjoy as long as they want. If the user(s) want to do something else, they can decide to leave and start a new surprise activity. The user first gets the option to block the activity in the future and then the whole procedure will be repeated.
See the necessary activities in the included excel sheet.
